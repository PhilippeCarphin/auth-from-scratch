#+TITLE: Clojure Web App: Auth From Scratch

This is an experiment in doing authentication from scratch.

The goal is to understand the very basics so that I can better understand how to
use libraries for such things.

And learn to use Clojure along the way.

* Requirements

[[https://leiningen.org][Leiningen]]

On MacOS, installed with Homebrew.

* Running

From the root of the project do

#+begin_src shell
lein run
#+end_src

Or start a REPL with

#+begin_src shell
lein repl
#+end_src

In the REPL, do =(-main)= to start the server.
