#+TITLE: Notes from the tutorial

* Prerequisites

** Leiningen

Some kind of build tool.  It can be installed with =brew install leiningen=.
* Initialize the project

Run
#+begin_src sh
lein new app <name>
#+end_src
which is how this directory was created with the following files:

#+begin_src
CHANGELOG.md
LICENSE
README.md
doc
project.clj
resources
src
test
#+end_src

* Hello world web app

Add =ring= as a dependency in =project.clj=.

Modify =core.clj=:
- Import ring with =require=
- Change main to call a ring function to which we pass a function.
  We also give it a port which is 8080 in this case.
- This function =app-handler= returns a map which is our HTML response.
  
Now we can do =lein run= and go to =localhost:8080= and see the HTML returned by
our app.
